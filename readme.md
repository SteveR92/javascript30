# JavaScript30 by Mike Ekkel
This repo holds all of my code that I've written during the JavaScript30 course / challenge by Wes Bos. Go check out this amazing free course at [javascript30.com](http://www.javascript30.com).

Along with this repo I am also writing about what I've learned and what I did different over on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mike_ekkel/javascript-30-a-30-day-vanilla-js-challenge-6a733fc9f62c#.3bumnq1f0).
